      I am the youngest sibling in our family. When I was younger, I lived with my grandma and grandpa.
       Because of that, I didn’t talk much and was really quiet. I mostly stayed at home and listened more than I spoke, 
       which made me an introvert.

    <h2>Welcome</h2>
    <p>
      I am the youngest sibling in our family. When I was younger, I lived with my grandma and grandpa. Because of that, I didn’t talk much and was really quiet. I mostly stayed at home and listened more than I spoke, which made me an introvert.
Back in elementary school, I didn’t have a lot of friends. I usually only had one or two, and sometimes I was okay being alone. I wasn’t very outgoing, and I felt shy around a lot of people.
As I grew older, I slowly changed. I learned how to talk more and became more comfortable around others. Now, I can enjoy being with people, but I also like having time to myself. That’s why I see myself as an ambivert now.
From this, I learned that it’s okay to be quiet and take your time. Living with my grandma and grandpa shaped who I am, and even though I don’t talk a lot, I’ve learned how to open up when it matters.
